--  Intensive testing
    Perhaps the delivery of the Beta will help a bit.

--  Documentation
    Like most WEB pages: under continuous construction

--  Style cleanup

--  Alternate functions for procedures with out params
    Comfort purpose

--  Sample program
    Under continuous construction (and it is not a WEB page!!!)

--  Make the binding objects a shared library
    They are rather large, so it would make sense, otherwise Ada95
    would look too large, although the generated code is as compact
    as C or C++. I'll wait a bit until the GNAT people provide some
    better support to construct shared libraries.

--  Think about more inlining

--  Check for memory leaks.
    Oh I would like it so much if the GNAT guys would put an optional
    GC into their system.
