# MKncurses_def.sh -- generate fallback definitions for ncurses_cfg.h
#
# Author: Thomas E. Dickey 2000
#
# Given the choice between constructs such as
#
#	#if defined(foo) && foo
#	#if foo
#
# we chose the latter.  It is guaranteed by the language standard, and there
# appear to be no broken compilers that do not honor that detail.  But some
# people want to use gcc's -Wundef option (corresponding to one of the less
# useful features in Watcom's compiler) to check for misspellings.  So we
# generate a set of fallback definitions to quiet the warnings without making
# the code ugly.
