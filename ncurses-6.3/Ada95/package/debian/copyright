    FSF changes to this file are in the public domain.

    Calling this script install-sh is preferred over install.sh, to prevent
    `make' implicit rules from creating a file called install from it
    when there is no Makefile.

    This script is compatible with the BSD install script, but was written
    from scratch.  It can only install one file at a time, a restriction
    shared with many OS's install programs.
