.TH menu_post 3X ""
.SH NAME
\fBpost_menu\fR,
\fBunpost_menu\fR \- write or erase menus from associated subwindows
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <menu.h>\fR
.sp
\fBint post_menu(MENU *\fP\fImenu\fP\fB);\fP
.br
\fBint unpost_menu(MENU *\fP\fImenu\fP\fB);\fP
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBpost_menu\fR displays a menu to its associated subwindow.
To
trigger physical display of the subwindow,
use \fBrefresh\fR(3X) or some equivalent
\fBcurses\fR routine (the implicit \fBdoupdate\fR triggered by an \fBcurses\fR
input request will do).
\fBpost_menu\fR resets the selection status of all items.
.PP
The function \fBunpost_menu\fR erases menu from its associated subwindow.
.SH RETURN VALUE
These routines return one of the following:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR(3)).
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
.B E_POSTED
The menu has already been posted.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_STATE
Routine was called from an initialization or termination function.
.TP 5
.B E_NO_ROOM
Menu is too large for its window.
You should consider using \fBset_menu_format\fR to solve the problem.
.TP 5
.B E_NOT_POSTED
The menu has not been posted.
.TP 5
.B E_NOT_CONNECTED
No items are connected to the menu.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X), \fBmenu\fR(3X).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<menu.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V menu library.
They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
