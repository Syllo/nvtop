.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions are used to simplify analysis of memory leaks in the ncurses
library.
.PP
Any implementation of curses must not free the memory associated with
a screen, since (even after calling \fBendwin\fP(3X)), it must be available
for use in the next call to \fBrefresh\fP(3X).
There are also chunks of memory held for performance reasons.
That makes it hard to analyze curses applications for memory leaks.
When using the specially configured debugging version of the ncurses library,
applications can call functions which free those chunks of memory,
simplifying the process of memory-leak checking.
.PP
Some of the functions are named with a \*(``_nc_\*('' prefix
because they are not intended for use in the non-debugging library:
.TP 5
\fB_nc_freeall\fP
This frees (almost) all of the memory allocated by ncurses.
.TP 5
\fB_nc_free_and_exit\fP
This frees the memory allocated by ncurses (like \fB_nc_freeall\fP),
and exits the program.
It is preferred over \fB_nc_freeall\fP since some of that memory
may be required to keep the application running.
Simply exiting (with the given exit-code) is safer.
.TP 5
\fB_nc_free_tinfo\fP
Use this function if only the low-level terminfo functions (and
corresponding library) are used.
Like \fB_nc_free_and_exit\fP, it exits the program after freeing memory.
.PP
The functions prefixed \*(``_nc\*('' are normally not available;
they must be configured into the library
at build time using the \fB\-\-disable-leaks\fP option.
That compiles-in code that frees memory that normally would not be freed.
.PP
The \fBexit_curses\fP and \fBexit_terminfo\fP functions
call \fB_nc_free_and_exit\fP and \fB_nc_free_tinfo\fP if
the library is configured to support memory-leak checking.
If the library is not configured to support memory-leak checking,
they simply call \fBexit\fP.
.SH RETURN VALUE
These functions do not return a value.
.SH PORTABILITY
These functions are not part of X/Open Curses;
nor do other implementations of curses provide a similar feature.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X).
