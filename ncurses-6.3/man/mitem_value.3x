.SH NAME
\fBset_item_value\fP,
\fBitem_value\fP \- set and get menu item values

\fB#include <menu.h>\fR
.sp
\fBint set_item_value(ITEM *\fP\fIitem\fP\fB, bool \fP\fIvalue\fP\fB);\fP
.br
\fBbool item_value(const ITEM *\fP\fIitem\fP\fB);\fP
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
If you turn off the menu option \fBO_ONEVALUE\fR (e.g., with
\fBset_menu_opts\fR or \fBmenu_opts_off\fR; see \fBmenu_opts\fR(3X)), the menu
becomes multi-valued; that is, more than one item may simultaneously be
selected.
.PP
In a multi_valued menu, you can used \fBset_item_value\fR to select the
given menu item (second argument \fBTRUE\fR) or deselect it (second argument
\fBFALSE\fR).
.SH RETURN VALUE
The function \fBset_item_value\fR returns one of the following:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR(3)).
.TP 5
.B E_REQUEST_DENIED
The menu driver could not process the request.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X), \fBmenu\fR(3X).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<menu.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V menu library.
They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
