.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions make it possible to set hook functions to be called at various
points in the automatic processing of input event codes by \fBform_driver\fR.
.PP
The function \fBset_field_init\fR sets a hook to be called at form-post time
and each time the selected field changes (after the change).
\fBfield_init\fR
returns the current field init hook, if any (\fBNULL\fR if there is no such
hook).
.PP
The function \fBset_field_term\fR sets a hook to be called at form-unpost time
and each time the selected field changes (before the change).
\fBfield_term\fR
returns the current field term hook, if any (\fBNULL\fR if there is no such
hook).
.PP
The function \fBset_form_init\fR sets a hook to be called at form-post time and
just after a page change once it is posted.
\fBform_init\fR returns the
current form init hook, if any (\fBNULL\fR if there is no such hook).
.PP
The function \fBset_form_term\fR sets a hook to be called at form-unpost time
and just before a page change once it is posted.
\fBform_init\fR
returns the current form term hook, if any (\fBNULL\fR if there is no such
hook).
.SH RETURN VALUE
Routines that return pointers return \fBNULL\fR on error.
Other routines
return one of the following:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR(3)).
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X), \fBform\fR(3X).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.
They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
