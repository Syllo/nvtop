.TH mitem_userptr 3X ""
.SH NAME
\fBset_item_userptr\fP,
\fBitem_userptr\fR \- associate application data with a menu item
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <menu.h>\fR
.sp
\fBint set_item_userptr(ITEM *\fP\fIitem\fP\fB, void *\fP\fIuserptr\fP\fB);\fP
.br
\fBvoid *item_userptr(const ITEM *\fP\fIitem\fP\fB);\fP
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
Every menu item has a field that can be used to hold application-specific data
(that is, the menu-driver code leaves it alone).
These functions get and set
that field.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The function \fBitem_userptr\fR returns a pointer (possibly \fBNULL\fR).
It does not set \fBerrno\fP.
.PP
The \fBset_item_userptr\fP always returns \fBE_OK\fP (success).
.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X), \fBmenu\fR(3X).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<menu.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V menu library.
They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
.PP
The user pointer is a void pointer.
We chose not to leave it as a char pointer for SVr4 compatibility.
.SH AUTHORS
