.SH NAME
\fB@INFOTOCAP@\fR \- convert a \fIterminfo\fR description into a \fItermcap\fR description
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB@INFOTOCAP@\fR [\fB\-v\fR\fIn\fR \fIwidth\fR]  [\fB\-V\fR] [\fB\-1\fR] [\fB\-w\fR \fIwidth\fR] \fIfile\fR ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB@INFOTOCAP@\fR looks in each given text
\fIfile\fR for \fBterminfo\fR descriptions.
For each terminfo description found,
an equivalent \fBtermcap\fR description is written to standard output.
Terminfo \fBuse\fR capabilities are translated directly to termcap
\fBtc\fR capabilities.

print out tracing information on standard error as the program runs.

.SH FILES
.TP 20
\*d

You can use other \fB@TIC@\fR options such as \fB\-f\fR and  \fB\-x\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
