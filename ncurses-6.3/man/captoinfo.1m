.SH NAME
\fB@CAPTOINFO@\fR \- convert a \fItermcap\fR description into a \fIterminfo\fR description
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB@CAPTOINFO@\fR [\fB\-v\fR\fIn\fR \fIwidth\fR]  [\fB\-V\fR] [\fB\-1\fR] [\fB\-w\fR \fIwidth\fR] \fIfile\fR ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB@CAPTOINFO@\fR looks in each given text
\fIfile\fR for \fBtermcap\fR descriptions.
For each
one found, an equivalent \fBterminfo\fR description is written to standard
output.
Termcap \fBtc\fR capabilities are translated directly to terminfo
\fBuse\fR capabilities.
.PP
If no \fIfile\fR is given, then the environment variable \fBTERMCAP\fR is used
for the filename or entry.
If \fBTERMCAP\fR is a full pathname to a file, only
the terminal whose name is specified in the environment variable \fBTERM\fR is
extracted from that file.
If the environment variable \fBTERMCAP\fR is not
set, then the file \fB\*d\fR is read.
.TP 5
\fB\-v\fR
print out tracing information on standard error as the program runs.
.TP 5
\fB\-V\fR
print out the version of the program in use on standard error and exit.
.TP 5
\fB\-1\fR
cause the fields to print out one to a line.
Otherwise, the fields
will be printed several to a line to a maximum width of 60
characters.
.TP 5
\fB\-w\fR
change the output to \fIwidth\fR characters.
.SH FILES
.TP 20
\*d
Compiled terminal description database.
.SH TRANSLATIONS FROM NONSTANDARD CAPABILITIES
.PP
Some obsolete nonstandard capabilities will automatically be translated
into standard (SVr4/XSI Curses) terminfo capabilities by \fB@CAPTOINFO@\fR.
Whenever one of these automatic translations is done, the program
will issue an notification to stderr, inviting the user to check that
it has not mistakenly translated a completely unknown and random
capability and/or syntax error.

XENIX termcap also used to have a set of extension capabilities
for forms drawing, designed to take advantage of the IBM PC
high-half graphics.

If the single-line capabilities occur in an entry, they will automatically
be composed into an \fBacsc\fR string.
The double-line capabilities and
\fBGG\fR are discarded with a warning message.
.PP
IBM's AIX has a terminfo facility descended from SVr1 terminfo but incompatible
with the SVr4 format.
The following AIX extensions are automatically
translated:

.PP
Additionally, the AIX \fIbox1\fR capability will be automatically translated to
an \fBacsc\fR string.
.PP
Hewlett-Packard's terminfo library supports two nonstandard terminfo
capabilities \fBmeml\fR (memory lock) and \fBmemu\fR (memory unlock).
These will be discarded with a warning message.
.SH NOTES
This utility is actually a link to \fB@TIC@\fR(1M), running in \fI\-I\fR mode.
You can use other \fB@TIC@\fR options such as \fB\-f\fR and  \fB\-x\fR.
.PP
The verbose option is not identical to SVr4's.
Under SVr4, instead of following
the \fB\-v\fR with a trace level n, you repeat it n times.
.SH PORTABILITY
X/Open Curses, Issue 7 (2009) describes \fBtic\fP briefly,
but omits this program.
SVr4 systems provide \fBcaptoinfo\fP as a separate application from \fBtic\fP.
.PP
NetBSD does not provide this application.
