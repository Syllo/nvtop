.SH NAME
\fBset_item_opts\fP,
\fBitem_opts_on\fP,
\fBitem_opts_off\fP,
\fBitem_opts\fR \- set and get menu item options
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <menu.h>\fR
.sp
\fBint set_item_opts(ITEM *\fP\fIitem\fP\fB, Item_Options \fP\fIopts\fP\fB);\fP
.br
\fBItem_Options item_opts(const ITEM *\fP\fIitem\fP\fB);\fP
.sp
\fBint item_opts_on(ITEM *\fP\fIitem\fP\fB, Item_Options \fP\fIopts\fP\fB);\fP
.br
\fBint item_opts_off(ITEM *\fP\fIitem\fP\fB, Item_Options \fP\fIopts\fP\fB);\fP
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBset_item_opts\fR sets all the given item's option bits (menu
option bits may be logically-OR'ed together).
.PP
The function \fBitem_opts_on\fR turns on the given option bits, and leaves
others alone.
.PP
The function \fBitem_opts_off\fR turns off the given option bits, and leaves
others alone.
.PP
The function \fBitem_opts\fR returns the item's current option bits.
.PP
There is only one defined option bit mask, \fBO_SELECTABLE\fR.  When this is
on, the item may be selected during menu processing.
This option defaults
to on.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Except for \fBitem_opts\fR, each routine returns one of the following:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR(3)).
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X), \fBmenu\fR(3X).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<menu.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V menu library.
They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
