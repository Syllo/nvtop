.SH NAME
\fBset_menu_format\fP,
\fBmenu_format\fP \- set and get menu sizes
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <menu.h>\fR
.sp
\fBint set_menu_format(MENU *\fP\fImenu\fP\fB, int \fP\fIrows\fP\fB, int \fP\fIcols\fP\fB);\fP
.br
\fBvoid menu_format(const MENU *\fP\fImenu\fP\fB, int *\fP\fIrows\fP\fB, int *\fP\fIcols\fP\fB);\fP
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBset_menu_format\fR sets the maximum display size of the given
menu.
If this size is too small to display all menu items, the menu will be
made scrollable.
If this size is larger than the menus subwindow and the
subwindow is too small to display all menu items, \fBpost_menu\fR will fail.
.PP
The default format is 16 rows, 1 column.
Calling \fBset_menu_format\fR with a
null menu pointer will change this default.
A zero row or column argument to
\fBset_menu_format\fR is interpreted as a request not to change the current
value.
.PP
The function \fBmenu_format\fR returns the maximum-size constraints for the
given menu into the storage addressed by \fBrows\fR and \fBcols\fR.
.SH RETURN VALUE
These routines returns one of the following:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR(3)).
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
.B E_POSTED
The menu is already posted.
.TP 5
.B E_NOT_CONNECTED
No items are connected to the menu.
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fR(3X), \fBmenu\fR(3X).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<menu.h>\fR automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V menu library.
They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
