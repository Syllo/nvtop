.SH NAME
\fBdelch\fR,
\fBwdelch\fR,
\fBmvdelch\fR,
\fBmvwdelch\fR \- delete character under the cursor in a \fBcurses\fR window
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR
.sp
\fBint delch(void);\fR
.br
\fBint wdelch(WINDOW *\fP\fIwin\fP\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint mvdelch(int \fP\fIy\fP\fB, int \fP\fIx\fP\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint mvwdelch(WINDOW *\fP\fIwin\fP\fB, int \fP\fIy\fP\fB, int \fP\fIx\fP\fB);\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines delete the character under the cursor; all characters to the
right of the cursor on the same line are moved to the left one position and the
last character on the line is filled with a blank.
The cursor position does
not change (after moving to \fIy\fR, \fIx\fR, if specified).
(This does not
imply use of the hardware delete character feature.)
.SH RETURN VALUE
All routines return the integer \fBERR\fR upon failure and an \fBOK\fR (SVr4
specifies only "an integer value other than \fBERR\fR") upon successful
completion.
.PP
Functions with a \*(``mv\*('' prefix first perform a cursor movement using
\fBwmove\fP, and return an error if the position is outside the window,
or if the window pointer is null.
.SH NOTES
Note that \fBdelch\fR, \fBmvdelch\fR, and \fBmvwdelch\fR may be macros.
.SH PORTABILITY
These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
The
standard specifies that they return \fBERR\fR on failure, but specifies no
error conditions.
