# man2html is a Perl script which assumes that pages are fixed size.
# Not all man programs agree with this assumption; some use half-spacing, which
# has the effect of lengthening the text portion of the page -- so man2html
# would remove some text.  The man program on Redhat 6.1 appears to work with
# man2html if we set the top/bottom margins to 6 (the default is 7).  Newer
# versions of 'man' leave no margin (and make it harder to sync with pages).
