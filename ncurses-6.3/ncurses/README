The llib-lXXXX files could be used as lint-library sources (and were, at one
time).  However, they are actually used as a documentation aid to keep track
of changes to the public/private interfaces in ncurses.  Most of the text in
these files is generated using cproto; some manual cleanup and adjustment of
types (to reflect #define's in curses.h) is needed.  The functions listed in
the llib-lXXXX files do not correspond to the default configure options; some
additional ones are added to include "all" of the entrypoints for each of the
major configurations (normal, wide-character, threaded):

	--disable-macros
	--disable-root-environ
	--enable-expanded
	--enable-getcap
	--enable-getcap-cache
	--enable-sp-funcs
	--enable-termcap
	--with-develop
