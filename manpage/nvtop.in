.SH NAME
nvtop \- interactive GPU process viewer

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nvtop
\fR[\fB\-hv\fR]
\fR[\fB\-si\fR \fIid1:id2:...\fR]
\fR[\fB\-d\fR \fIdelay\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
nvtop is a ncurses\-based GPU status viewer for AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.

.SH COMMAND\-LINE OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-d ", " \-\-delay =\fIdelay\fR
Delay between updates, in tenths of seconds (\fIdelay\fR * 0.1s).
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Print the help and exit.
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-gpu\-select =\fIid1:...\fR
Colon separated list of GPU IDs to be monitored by nvtop.
.TP
.BR \-i ", " \-\-gpu\-ignore =\fIid1:...\fR
Colon separated list of GPU IDs to be ignored by nvtop.
.TP
.BR \-C ", " \-\-no\-color
Monochrome mode.
.TP
.BR \-f ", " \-\-freedom\-unit
Use fahrenheit as temperature scale.
.TP
.BR \-E ", " \-\-encode\-hide =\fIseconds\fR
Modify the setting for the encode/decode auto-hide timer. Always visible if negative. Default to 30 seconds.
.TP
.BR \-r ", " \-\-reverse\-abs
Reverse abscissa: switch the plot data order from "old --- recent" (default) to "recent --- old".
.TP
.BR \-p ", " \-\-no\-plot
Show only one bar plot corresponding to the maximum of all GPUs.
.TP
.BR \-v ", " \-\-version
Print the version and exit.

.SH INTERACTIVE SETUP WINDOW
.TP
You can enter the setup utility by pressing \fBF2\fR to view and modify the following interface options:
.TP
.I General
This section deals with general interface options. \fBColor support\fR and \fBinterface update interval\fR can be modified.
.TP
.I Devices
This section deals with the devices display (top of the interface). You can \fBswitch the temperature scale to fahrenheit\fR and \fBset the encoder/decoder hiding timer\fR.
.TP
.I Chart
This section deals with the line plots (middle of the interface). You can \fBreverse the plot direction\fR and \fBselect which metric is being shown in the plots\fR.
.TP
.I Processes
This section deals with the process list (bottom of the interface). You can \fBselect the sort order\fR, \fBselect the metric by which to sort the processes by\fR and \fBselect which metric is displayed\fR.

.SH INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
.TP
The following commands are available while in nvtop:
.TP
.BR Up
Select (highlight) the previous process.
.TP
.BR Down
Select (highlight) the next process.
.TP
.BR Left\ /\ Right
Scroll in the process row.
.TP
.BR +
Sort increasingly.
.TP
.BR -
Sort decreasingly.
.TP
.BR F2
Enter the setup utility to modify the interface options.
.TP
.BR F12
Save the current interface options to persistent storage.
See the \fBCONFIGURATION FILE\fR section.
.TP
.BR F9
"Kill" process: Select a signal to send to the highlighted process.
.TP
.BR F6
Sort: Select the field for sorting. The current sort field is highlighted inside the header bar.
.TP
.BR F10 ", " q ", " Esc
Quit.

.SH DYNAMIC METERS
.TP
When the video encoder (ENC) and decoder (DEC) of the GPU are in use, new percentage meters will appear next to the GPU utilization bar. They will disappear automatically after some time of inactivity (see option -E).

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
.LP
The configuration file follows the \fIXDG Base Directory Specification\fR and is stored at \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvtop/interface.ini\fR. The location defaults to \fI$HOME/.config/nvtop/interface.ini\fR if the XDG location is not defined.
.LP
Do not edit this file. The file is automatically created or updated upon toggling the interface saving key \fBF12\fR.
.LP
The configuration is loaded during program initialization.
If no configuration file is present, default options are used.

.SH MEMORY SIZES
.TP
Memory sizes in nvtop are displayed as multiples of 1024 bytes or 1 KiB.

.SH BUGS
.TP
.BR "Some fields are shown as N/A"
Ask AMD or NVIDIA for better support of your hardware!

If your card uses the AMDGPU driver, a more recent kernel might have improved support.
.TP
.BR "Compatibility issues"
Does not work with nouveau driver stack and older NVIDIA GPU for the time being.

Does not work for AMD graphics card using the old radeon driver.
